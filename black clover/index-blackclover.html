        <p>Black Clover (Japanese: ブラッククローバー, Hepburn: Burakku Kurōbā) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated 
             by Yūki Tabata. The story follows Asta, a young boy born without any magic power. This is unknown to the world he lives
             in because seemingly everyone has some sort of magic power. With his fellow mages from the Black Bulls, Asta plans to become 
             the next Wizard King. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since February 2015, with
             its chapters collected in 32 tankōbon volumes as of April 2022. The manga was first adapted into an original video animation 
             produced by Xebec Zwei, released in 2017. An anime television series adaptation produced by Pierrot aired in Japan on TV Tokyo
             from October 2017 to March 2021.</p>

                            <p class="character-info">Asta 「アスタ Asuta」 is the main protagonist of the Black Clover franchise. 
                                He is an orphan who was raised at a church in the village called Hage. Asta is a young man with a 
                                short stature, but a strong, ripped build and a pair of green eyes. He also has messy ash blond hair 
                                and a single strand protruding upwards from the center of his head. He keeps his hair together with a 
                                black headband, which has the gold-colored Black Bull insignia and a red-colored four-sided star with 
                                three stitches on it. Asta is a cheerful and hyperactive boy who tends to shout a lot to express his 
                                thoughts and expresses his goals, without a care in the world for other people's opinions, as seen when 
                                he expressed his goal of becoming a Wizard King during the Magic Knights entrance exam, where he tells
                                other people who disagree with him to shut up. His strong tenacity attracts Yami Sukehiro enough to
                                recruit him into his ranks. His strong determination also leads him to have a strong will to never give 
                                up and keep standing during difficult battles, as acknowledged by Magna Swing.</p>

            <p class="character-info">Yuno is the secondary protagonist and Asta's rival in their quest of becoming the Wizard King.
                 He and Asta were dropped off at the gate of the same orphanage so they grew up together. In the series, Yuno is the 
                 first person to acknowledge Asta's strength. Yuno is a young man of average height with a lean build, gold eyes, and messy
                 black hair. His main outfit consists of a pitch-black shirt with a high collar and long sleeves. The sleeves have brown leather
                 that cover the wrists and upper arms. He wears light brown pants that are cut below his knees and, around his waist, a pair of 
                 brown belts that cross each other. Additionally, he wears a pair of dark-colored socks and a pair of boots. He carries his grimoire
                 in a pouch strapped at his right-hand side of his waist. Later on, Yuno starts wearing the squad's signature robes. 
                 Yuno has a calm and emotionless demeanor and speaks only when he really 
                 needs to convey his thoughts. His manner of speaking often makes people misinterpret what he means. Despite his detached 
                 nature, Yuno harbors a strong ambition to be the Magic Emperor, which he developed while growing up with Asta. Additionally,
                 Yuno has a sense of rivalry with him so strong that he will go to any length to stop anyone who tries to put Asta in harm's way.
                 He also goes out of his way to make Asta look good in the eyes of others, even to the point of Asta's expense, such as when he attacked
                 Asta with his most powerful magic, knowing Asta would block it. Yuno is also known to be very blunt and not hold back what he thinks.
