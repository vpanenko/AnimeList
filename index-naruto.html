        <p> Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, 
            a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. 
            The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based 
            on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop 
            Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997). Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 
            to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by 
            Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network 
            and YTV from 2005 to 2009.</p>
            <p> Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes.</p>
            <h1 class="text"> My opinion and impressions</h1>

            <p>Naruto one of the best anime i ever watched and why this is in that list. Naruto's way from his lonely childhood
                when he was weakest to his dream future really exciting to watch. Anime full of inspiration on various topics but primary 
                is that u should never give up exactly what Naruto did to make his future the way he wanted. Full Naruto grown and how he become strongest 
                really exciting to watch. Also anime has 10 movies unfortunatelly i didnt watch a single one.
                and i strongly recommend to watch it to everyone who little bit watch anime. I think i said everything i want and thats why this is anime
                strongly
