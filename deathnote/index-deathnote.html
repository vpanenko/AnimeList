            <p>Death Note (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata.
                 The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to 
                 the shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. The
                 series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals 
                 whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the 
                 subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him. Death Note ran
                 in Shueisha's manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006. Its 108 chapters were collected in 12 
                 tankōbon volumes.</p>

                    <p class="text">Light Yagami (夜神月, Yagami Raito) is the main protagonist of the Death Note series. After discovering
                         the Death Note, he decides to use it to rid the world of criminals. His killings are eventually labelled by the
                         people living in Japan as the work of "Kira." Light is a young man, standing at above average height with
                         light-brown hair and brown eyes. During Part I, when not wearing his school uniform, which consists of a tan suit
                         and red tie, he dresses fairly casually, sometimes sporting a dress shirt underneath a jacket or a V-neck sweater
                         with a collared t-shirt underneath. During Part II, if not wearing a similar style of clothes, he is seen wearing 
                         a suit. Light is characterized as hardworking, talented, and a natural genius. Highly perceptive and good with
                         problem solving skills, Light is a skilled planner and good at mapping out scenarios. Furthermore, Light is very 
                         popular among peers and adored by his family members. However, his high intelligence and constant praise from adults
                         laid the foundation for an intense level of hubris which quickly took effect once he obtained the notebook.</p>

                    <p class="text">L (エル, Eru) is a world-renowned detective who takes on the challenge of catching the mass murderer
                         known as Kira. In his investigation, L becomes suspicious of Light Yagami and makes it his goal to prove that Light
                         is Kira. L is a very slim, pale, tall young man with messy neck-length black hair and black eyes. One of his most 
                         noticeable features is the shadow below each of his eyes, a result of him being an insomniac. L is always shown 
                         to be wearing a pair of blue jeans and a long-sleeved white shirt. He almost never wears shoes or socks, preferring
                         to go barefoot, even while in public. This was shown when he visited Light Yagami's school and was seen barefoot
                         while sitting on a bench, not bothering to wear his shoes until he got up to walk. L also tends to hunch over when
                         walking. L is quite secretive, and only communicates with the world through his assistant, Watari. He never shows
                         his face to the world in person, instead representing himself with a capital letter L drawn in "Old English MT" or
                         "Cloister Black" typeface. It is more likely to be "Cloister Black" as Watari's "W" is different in "Old English MT."</p>

                        <p class="text">Ryuk (リューク, Ryūku) is a Shinigami who indirectly gives Light Yagami a Death Note after becoming 
                         bored with the Shinigami Realm. In an effort to amuse himself, he steals a second Death Note and drops it into
                         the Human World for someone to find. This Death Note is discovered by Light, who uses it in an attempt to cleanse
                         the world of evil and injustice, satisfying Ryuk's need for entertainment. Ryuk has a fairly humanoid appearance.
                         He is extremely slim and has light-gray skin, almost blue-ish in color, with spiky black hair; thin, blue-gray 
                         lips; and sharp, pointed teeth. His limbs are abnormally long, and he wears rings on his fingers. He has large,
                         round yellow eyes with bright red irises and retractable feather-like wings on his back that enable him to fly.
                         Ryuk is different from most Shinigami in that he does not want to simply pass time away in the Shinigami Realm but
                         find something to relieve his boredom, and he is unaffected by the mocking he receives from other Shinigami for it.</p>
