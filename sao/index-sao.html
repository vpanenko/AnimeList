            Kawahara and illustrated by abec. The series takes place in the near future and focuses on protagonists Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya
            and Asuna Yuuki as they play through various virtual reality MMORPG worlds. Kawahara originally wrote the series as a web novel 
            on his website from 2002 to 2008. The light novels began publication on ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Bunko imprint from April 10,
            2009, with a spin-off series launching in October 2012. The series has spawned twelve manga adaptations published by ASCII 
            Works and Kadokawa. The novels and the manga adaptations have been licensed for release in North America by Yen Press.</p>

                    Kazuto?), and known as Kirito (キリト, Kirito?) in «Sword Art Online» (SAO), «ALfheim Online» (ALO), «Gun Gale Online» 
                    (GGO), «Project Alicization», and Unital Ring, is the protagonist of the main Sword Art Online series.
                    Kirito described the appearance of his avatar at the beginning of the game and the beta-testing phase as having the
                    appearance of a ridiculously handsome protagonist from some fantasy animation, looking noticeably older than he actually
                    was. His in-game height was equal to that of his height in the real world to prevent the extra height from hindering his
                    movements. Kazuto is someone who is not good with words, as stated by Klein, and can be quite direct.
                    This is due to him not having many friends and closing others off because of his love for computers.
                    Thus, he can appear to be rude to others, such as Lisbeth and Sinon. Sometimes, he 
                    actually seems to enjoy angering and teasing people as well. Also, from time to time, Kazuto can be 
                    quite overconfident thinking he can do things others cannot.</p>

                        «ALfheim Online» (ALO), as well as «Project Alicization», where she had temporarily used the Stacia (ステイシア, 
                        Suteishia?) account, is the main heroine of the Sword Art Online series, the deuteragonist of the Aincrad Arc,
                        as well as the protagonist of the Mother's Rosario side story. She is the daughter of the former CEO of RECT Inc.. 
                        Asuna was one of the 10,000 players trapped in «Sword Art Online», where she was the sub-leader of the «Knights of 
                        the Blood» (KoB) guild. Her skills with the rapier had her earned her the nickname «The Flash» (閃光, Senkō?).
                        Asuna has long, orange-brownish chestnut hair and hazel eyes. In the early levels of SAO, she wore a dark red
                        leather tunic with a lightweight copper breastplate and leather pants with boots up to the knees along with a hooded
                        cape. After joining the «Knights of the Blood», she wore a red and white uniform that all KoB members wear
                        and wielded a rapier made by Lisbeth, called the «Lambent Light».. After the Ordinal Scale Incident, Asuna 
                        started wearing the promise ring given to her by Kazuto on her left ring finger. Asuna originally did not care about
                        dying in the game before meeting Kirito. That meeting drastically changed Asuna's personality and outlook on life. 
                        She soon takes most things Kirito says to heart and looks to him for help, using him as somewhat of a lifeline.</p>
