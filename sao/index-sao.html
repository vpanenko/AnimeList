                <p class="text">Kirigaya Kazuto (桐ヶ谷 和人, Kirigaya Kazuto?), born as Narusaka Kazuto (鳴坂 和人なるさか かずと, Narusaka 
                    Kazuto?), and known as Kirito (キリト, Kirito?) in «Sword Art Online» (SAO), «ALfheim Online» (ALO), «Gun Gale Online» 
                    (GGO), «Project Alicization», and Unital Ring, is the protagonist of the main Sword Art Online series.
                    Kirito described the appearance of his avatar at the beginning of the game and the beta-testing phase as having the
                    appearance of a ridiculously handsome protagonist from some fantasy animation, looking noticeably older than he actually
                    was. His in-game height was equal to that of his height in the real world to prevent the extra height from hindering his
                    movements. Kazuto is someone who is not good with words, as stated by Klein, and can be quite direct.
                    This is due to him not having many friends and closing others off because of his love for computers.
                    Thus, he can appear to be rude to others, such as Lisbeth and Sinon.[citation needed] Sometimes, he 
                    actually seems to enjoy angering and teasing people as well.[citation needed] Also, from time to time, Kazuto can be 
                    quite overconfident thinking he can do things others cannot.</p>
