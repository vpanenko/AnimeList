                <p class="text">Jonathan Joestar (ジョナサン・ジョースター Jonasan Jōsutā) is the main protagonist of the first part of the JoJo's
                     Bizarre Adventure series, Phantom Blood, and the first JoJo of the series. His legacy extends throughout almost
                     the entirety of the first six parts of the series, with major characters such as Joseph Joestar and Jotaro Kujo 
                     being his descendants. Jonathan is the son of the wealthy businessman George Joestar I and Mary Joestar. He is
                     an honest, kind, and positive man whose life is fraught with tragedy after meeting his adopted older brother - 
                     and series antagonist - Dio Brando. In his battle against Dio, Jonathan becomes a Ripple user under the tutelage 
                     of his master Will Anthonio Zeppeli. During his childhood, Jonathan was proud and mischievous, yet gentle.
                     Despite already aspiring to be a "true gentleman", Jonathan lacked manners and mostly behaved like a normal 
                     child. His mother, having died before he could remember her, and his fellow boys ostracizing him because of his
                     status left Jonathan somewhat lonely. While at first, Jonathan didn't have his future strength of will,
                     Dio unwittingly became the catalyst of his growth by pushing him to the edge and humiliating his girlfriend 
                     Erina Pendleton. However, he did have the kindness and courage to immediately jump to Erina's rescue against
                     two bullies bigger than him despite not knowing her.</p>

                     ally in Part 3 and 4. He is the 2nd JoJo of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series. He is also the second
                     most recurring JoJo in the series. Joseph is a natural-born Ripple user and eventual Stand user, wielding 
                     the psychic photographic Stand, Hermit Purple. Joseph meets the fantastic threats approaching him throughout
                     his life with initiative and impressive ingenuity, battling Vampires, the Pillar Men, and malevolent Stand users.
                     In Battle Tendency, Joseph is a hotheaded, impetuous, and confrontational young man. Quick to violently respond 
                     to the slightest provocation, Joseph would often get into brawls growing up; prior to events of the story, he had
                     been imprisoned seven times and expelled once from school for fighting. Having no respect for authority save of 
                     his grandmother's, and later Lisa Lisa's, Joseph has antagonised policemen and mafiosi alike. Furthermore, 
                     Joseph is a foul-mouthed individual and regularly taunts his enemies, enjoying aggravating them. His signature taunt 
                     is predicting his enemy's next line, which is shown to be correct all the time. He notably taunted Kars when he
                     launched him into space, claiming to have again planned everything from the beginning just to annoy him.</p>

                    <p class="text">Giorno Giovanna (ジョルノ・ジョバァーナ Joruno Jobāna) is the protagonist of Part 5 and the fifth JoJo
                         of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series. Giorno is the illegitimate son of DIO, conceived with Jonathan Joestar's 
                         stolen body. He is introduced as Haruno Shiobana (汐華 初流乃). He speaks of his intention to join the powerful
                         gang Passione and his dream of becoming a "Gang-Star". He is also featured in the light novel JORGE JOESTAR as an 
                         ally. Giorno is a natural-born Stand User wielding the life-giving Gold Experience in battle.
                         Giorno is a teenage boy of average height and slim yet muscular build, far smaller in stature than previous
                         JoJos. He has golden hair of moderate length tied back in a short, braided tail, with three distinctive oversized
                         curls arranged in a row over his forehead. His hair was originally black and unkempt but transformed upon 
                         awakening his Stand. His eyes, especially present in earlier depictions, sharpen at the ends similar to 
                         those of his father's. Giorno's childhood was filled with unhappiness and loneliness due to bullies and the abuse
                         by his stepfather. During his early childhood, he was initially cold and uncaring towards anyone and believed
                         himself to be scum just for the way people treated him. Those that knew him easily thought he'd grow up to become
                         a twisted individual. This changed when he befriended an injured gangster he saved. As the man protected Giorno
                         from those that did him wrong in return for his aid, he learned that he could trust people. Since then, he has
                         become a more confident and solicitous person.</p>

                         of Jolyne.Jolyne's childhood was often spent without her father, as Jotaro was mostly at work even when she was in need of
                         attention. When she was fourteen, her life as a teen began to spiral downward upon being mistaken for a suspect in a robbery 
                         she didn't commit and then fleeing from an officer by stealing a motorcycle. Upon being arrested and detained in a holding
                         cell, falsely charged with the crime, she and her mother pleaded her innocence and even begged Jotaro to bail her out.
                         However, as he did not believe her, she ended up being sent to juvenile detention.
