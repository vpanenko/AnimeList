                       <p class="text">Mugen (無限, Infinity) is one of the main male protagonists of Samurai Champloo along with Jin. 
                        Both Mugen and Jin accompany Fuu in her search for "the samurai who smells of sunflowers." Mugen serves as a 
                        foil to Jin in terms of personality and disposition. His fighting style is characterized as being reckless and 
                        erratic. Mugen has messy black hair and a faint beard.

                        His clothing is anachronistic as well, reminiscent of baggy hip-hop fashions of today. His attire consists of a
                         light grey shirt with a stitch pattern running down the middle and ending at the halfway point of the shirt. 
                         He wears this under a red short-sleeve happi that functions as a jacket. He wears dark gray hakama cut off at 
                         shorts-length, resembling loose-fitting Bermuda shorts and Japanese Geta (wooden sandals) on his feet. Rude, lewd,
                         vulgar, conceited, temperamental, and unhinged - Mugen is something of an antihero. He is fond of fighting and has
                         a tendency to pick fights for petty reasons. In several episodes it is made clear that Mugen is a womanizer, and
                         his libido often gets the better of him. Character designer Kazuto Nakazawa stated in an interview: "When I was
                         doing character design, the most difficult one was Mugen, as I expected. I'm pretty sure that as far as the 
                         director's image went, he probably was thinking of someone like a 'rapper who acts like a bad guy.' But the way
                         Mugen acts is relatively based on his core conviction."</p>

                           <p class="text">Jin (仁, Benevolence) is one of the main male protagonists of Samurai Champloo. He is one of Fuu's
                             two bodyguards, along with Mugen and a former student of kenjutsu who, after killing his own master in 
                             self-defense, fled and eventually became involved with Fuu and Mugen.Jin is a bespectacled young man with 
                             long black hair that is tied in a low loose ponytail with two strands framing his face on either side and 
                             dark-brown eyes. His attire is a simple indigo blue haori that is adorned with multiple symbols that are four
                             squares in a diamond formation on the right pec, sleeves and back of his haori and a white keikogi and hakama.
                             He wears a teal beaded bracelet on both his wrists, which are actually Buddhist prayer beads. His pair of 
                             glasses is purely ornamental as Mugen later found out after getting a chance to peer through them.
                             Unlike Fuu and Mugen, Jin is a calm and collected guy under the most dire of circumstances as he leads both Fuu
                             and Mugen to confide in him. However, his stoic demeanor can irritate his companions since he responds to their
                             thoughts with sighs or grunts. By his own admission, Jin has spent most of his time focusing on improving his 
                             skills and almost no time at all on cultivating friends. This lack of companionship means that he values the 
                             friendship of Fuu and Mugen as he seems genuinely saddened when the three part ways. Although the two annoy him
                             on occasion, he is often willing to take on an extremely deadly opponent alone in order to allow them to escape.</p>

                               <p class="text">Fuu (フウ, Tanagers), full name Fuu Kasami (Kasami Fuu 香澄 フウ), is the tritagonist and
                                 leading lady of Samurai Champloo. Following a series of circumstances, she tricks Mugen and Jin into 
                                 accompanying her into her journey in finding the "Sunflower Samurai". Fuu has brown hair that is tied in 
                                 the style of a ponytail with bangs parted where a small portion hangs down to the right while there is a 
                                 larger portion hanging toward the left side, brown eyes and she is shown to have color pink fingernails and
                                 toenails. She wears a deep pink kimono with a floral pattern and she carries a kaiken (woman’s dagger) with
                                 a pink handle and sheath, and a floral pattern matching her kimono. Attached to the kaiken are three netsuke
                                 (charms): a skull (a Christian pendant from her father), a pair of dice and a dog. Fuu's relationship with Mugen
                                 and Jin is apparently sororal (of or like a sister) where she has a bright and trusting personality. She is
                                 highly prone to accidents, getting lost, and finding trouble, although she is quite practical. She often puts 
                                 on a front of being more worldly and experienced than she actually is so as not to appear completely idiotic in
                                 front of her bodyguards.
