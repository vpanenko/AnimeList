                <p class="text">Ganta Igarashi (五十嵐 丸太, Igarashi Ganta) a.k.a Woodpecker, is the main protagonist of the series. He 
                    is also the son of Sorae Igarashi and the childhood friend of Shiro. Because of his Deadman powers, he was sent to 
                    Deadman Wonderland. There, he swore vengeance on the "Red Man", for framing him of murdering his classmates. In the 
                    beginning of the series, Ganta is a harmless and ordinary school boy. Once in Deadman Wonderland, he is initially 
                    confused and frightened by the brutality of the prison. During his time in prison, he learns to live with the insanity 
                    but is still determined to stop Tamaki's tyranny. He is also quite vengeful, seeking retribution for the death of his 
                    classmates at the hands of the Red Man for most of the series. He follows the prisoners rules and trying to avoid them 
                    and not get involved. After being sent to G-ward, he is even more confused and scared of being forced to fight each 
                    other for others amusement and grossed out by Tamaki's punishment game. His life turns for worse when Scar Chain is 
                    betrayed by Rokuro and, again, witnessing the slaughter of his comrades, driving Ganta into a rage of wanting to get 
                    revenge and save his remaining comrades. In moments of great emotion, Ganta's character can change and he begins to 
                    curse and make use of derogatory actions. Ganta has short black hair and bluish-gray eyes.</p>

                    <p class="text">Shiro (シロ, Shiro) is a childhood friend of Ganta Igarashi and Hagire Rinichirō's adopted daughter. 
                        Sorae Igarashi and Hagire experimented on her in order to gain insight in how to heighten a person's immune system.
                        This experimentation unintentionally caused Shiro to become the very first Deadman. Shiro developed a second 
                        personality called the Wretched Egg (レチッドエッグ, Rechiddo Eggu) or the Red Man (赤い男, Akai Otoko) in order 
                        to cope with her suffering. Shiro is a young albino girl. She has snow-white hair, pale skin and red eyes; even 
                        her eyebrows and eyelashes are white. Her hair is very long and reaches down to her knees. She dresses in a peach, 
                        skintight bodysuit (white in the anime), decorated with red circles and stripes and with her toes and heels 
                        sticking out. She also wears big brown mittens and a white neck warmer, though has been seen wearing black mittens 
                        with a black neck warmer and also black winter boots. Ganta has mentioned that she looks like Mimi. Shiro is a 
                        clumsy and bubbly young girl. She has lots of energy, most likely from the fact she eats nothing but sweets. She 
                        is shown to have loved sweets throughout her life, particularly cookies, and her sweet tooth may be her way of 
                        staying connected to her childhood. She has a very childlike outlook on life; this leads to her not understanding 
                        much: Shiro didn't even understand the concept of a girlfriend and had a simplified outlook on love.</p>
