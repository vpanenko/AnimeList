        <p> Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, 
            a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. 
            The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based 
            on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop 
            Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997). Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 
            to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by 
            Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network 
            and YTV from 2005 to 2009.</p>
            <p> Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes.</p>

                <p class="character-text">Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan.
                     He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him 
                     to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. Naruto is noted as boisterous, exuberant, and unorthodox,
                     quite similar to Hashirama Senju. He inherited his mother's verbal tic, as he ends his sentences with "Dattebayo!" 
                     (だってばよ!) when emotional. Though he responds best to competition and is not afraid to ask for assistance, Naruto 
                     is relatively naïve and slow to understand principles or situations. He often requires an oversimplified analogy in
                     order to grasp explanations and can even prove forgetful. Naruto is aware of his faults and admits he acts
                     strong to mask his embarrassment and frustration about them. Despite his naivety, Naruto can be quite
                     observant, picking up on things others miss and retaining information casually gathered through conversation.</p>

                <p class="character-text"> Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's 
                     Uchiha clan and Naruto's rival. Sasuke was a happy child, eager to please and be worthy of his clan name. One of Sasuke's most significant
                     bonds is the one he has with his older brother, Itachi, who by merely being mentioned can elicit strong reactions from 
                     Sasuke's otherwise calm demeanour. Sasuke adored Itachi when he was a boy, enjoying his company above all others'; as an
                     infant, he would cry whenever he was held by someone besides Itachi and would immediately be happy once held by his big
                     brother again that want. His only goal in life became to take revenge for his clan's deaths by any means, even if it meant 
                     acquiring power that wasn't his own. According to Hashirama Senju, Sasuke bears a strong resemblance to Izuna Uchiha: he has 
                     black eyes and spiky black hair with a blue tint. Sasuke's hair is long and has hung over his face as bangs since he was a child, 
                     which as he gets older he allows to grow longer and, in turn, cover more of his face.</p>

                   <p class="character-text">Sakura Haruno (春野サクラ, Sakura Haruno ) is a kunoichi of Konohagakure. When assigned
                     to Team 7, Sakura quickly finds herself ill-prepared for the duties of a shinobi. As a child, Sakura was insecure and
                     highly self-conscious about her large forehead, covering it with her bangs. It was not until she met Ino, who defended 
                     her from bullies and became her friend, that she become more self-confident. At the start of Part I, Sakura typically gives 
                     the outward impression of being polite to her superiors, considerate of her peers, and confident in herself. She has occasional
                     moments of bashfulness around Sasuke and competitiveness around Ino, but otherwise appears quite collected. This reservation,
                     though never disingenuous, frequently masks how Sakura feels: in certain situations, she has pronounced feelings of 
                     delinquency, jealousy, and anger. Sakura has fair skin, green eyes, and pink hair. In her youth, she wore her hair as bangs in order
                     to cover her large forehead and fend off her classmates' calling her "Forehead Girl" (デコリーン, Dekorīn). Ino encouraged her not to do
                     this and wear her hair back instead, so that others could see her face.</p>

                  <p class="character-text">Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. 
                     Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja,
                     regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on 
                     Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork. Since his early childhood, Kakashi was very independent and
                     self-confident, at times even appearing arrogant and condescending. Despite that, Kakashi was very perceptive and
                     intuitive, quickly realising the situation for what it was. After his father's death, Kakashi became more stern, 
                     aloof and cold toward others, following all the rules to the letter, chastising any who disobeyed them and being
                     willing to abandon his comrades to finish missions. Kakashi has a strong resemblance to his father, so much so that 
                     they are sometimes mistaken for each other. He has spiky silver hair often oriented to his left-side, dark grey
                     eyes (black in several instances), and typically a relaxed and lazy expression.</p>
