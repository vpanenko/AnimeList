        <p>The Promised Neverland (Japanese: 約束のネバーランド, Hepburn: Yakusoku no Nebārando) is a Japanese manga series written by Kaiu 
            Shirai and illustrated by Posuka Demizu. It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump from August 2016 to June 2020, with 
            its chapters collected in twenty tankōbon volumes. In North America, Viz Media licensed the manga for English release and serialized 
            it on their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The series follows a group of orphaned children in their plan to escape from their 
            orphanage, after learning the dark truth behind their existence and the purpose of the orphanage.</p>

                <p class="text">Emma (エマ, Ema?) is the main protagonist of The Promised Neverland.Caring and extroverted, Emma often proves 
                    herself to be one of the most reliable orphans and is often seen surrounded by friends. She is known for her incredible 
                    ability to learn, capable athleticism, and ample optimism. Being one of the smartest children living in the Grace Field 
                    House, Emma is considered as one of Grace Field House's three "Premium quality goods" along with Norman and Ray.After 
                    her success of escaping Grace Field alongside Ray and 13 other orphans, Emma seeks to find William Minerva, 
                    whom she believes can grant her and her friends the liberty to live a safe and peaceful life away from the demons.
                    Emma is a young, fair-skinned girl of thin build who has emerald oval-shaped eyes and notably thin eyebrows. Her hair is 
                    a light orange color that is short and messy, sticking up at all angles around her head and worn parted to her right with 
                    a single longed lock curving upwards to one side from her parting, and another from the base of her neck. Although not as 
                    prominent in the manga, it appears to grow darker the further down it goes, ranging from a pale yellow-orange to a darker 
                    shade. Like all the other children at the orphanage, Emma wore the standard uniform— a white shirt and skirt along with 
                    plain brown shoes. Her identification number, "63194", can be seen on the left side of her neck.Emma is an extremely 
                    optimistic, loud, and cheerful girl full of life, whose athletic abilities and extroverted nature contracts directly to 
                    Norman's weak physique and Ray's introverted nature. Emma plays the part as an elder sister figure among her younger 
                    ones, and always shows unlimited love and care for her fellow foster siblings. When she discovered Conny's corpse and 
                    the truth behind Grace Field and Isabella, Emma underwent an emotional change and decided to never cry again and stay 
                    steadfast with her beliefs and decisions.</p>

                    <p class="text">Ray (レイ, Rei?) is one of the deuteragonists of The Promised Neverland alongside with Norman.
                        Ray is a model student of Grace Field House, who consistently gets perfect scores during the daily exams. He is 
                        also known for being an avid reader with high intellectual abilities, blunt skepticism, and cunning. Despite his 
                        distant disposition, Ray is able to interact well with the orphans and is fiercely loyal and caring to particularly 
                        Emma and Norman.Being one of the smartest children living in Grace Field, Ray is considered to be one of Grace Field 
                        House's three "Premium quality goods" next to Norman and Emma.After his success of escaping Grace Field alongside 
                        Emma and 13 other orphans, Ray now seeks William Minerva, whom he believes can grant him and his family liberty and 
                        help them find a safe and peaceful life away from the demons. Ray is a slim boy of average height with somewhat 
                        messy short black hair, parted to the right so that the longer, chin-length clumps on his left obscure much of his 
                        face. Around the sides, it appears to spike upwards, following the shape of his head, and he also has triangular 
                        forest-green eyes with noticeably small black irises. Ray appears to be aloof, introverted and snarky; often 
                        excluding himself from playing with the other orphans and prefers to read load of books instead. However, he is able 
                        to interact well with his fellow siblings and loves them all deeply. Even if there are times when they do not get 
                        along, he still deeply cares about their well-being and would go to great lengths to keep them safe. An outspoken 
                        person with little patience for inconvenience and silliness (like Emma's), he frequently loses his temper or is often 
                        left dumbfounded when people such as Emma display reckless behavior and intentions, noticeably when he considered 
                        Emma as an "airhead" when she intended to rescue every orphan from Grace Field.</p>

                        <p class="text">Norman (ノーマン, Nōman?) is one of the deuteragonists of The Promised Neverland alongside Ray. Norman 
                            is a math prodigy and a model student of Grace Field House, with intelligence that surpasses his peers and even 
                            adults. He is also known for being a genius strategist and planner, as well as unbeatable at the game of tag. 
                            Being the smartest child living in Grace Field, Norman is considered as one of Grace Field House's three "Premium 
                            quality goods" next to Emma and Ray.When he discovers the truth about the orphanage with Emma, he teams up with 
                            her and Ray to devise a plan to escape. Norman is, however, forced to be shipped before his 12th birthday, and he 
                            sacrifices himself and accepts his fate of inevitable death to let his family escape.In reality, Norman was 
                            transferred to an experimentation plantation called Λ7214. One-and-a-half years later, he managed to escape and 
                            destroy Λ7214 along with his new-found comrades. Witnessing the true horrors of the farm system, Norman hoped to 
                            completely annihilate all demons and create a sanctuary for all humans in the demon world. Norman is a young boy 
                            with short, tidy white hair (platinum blonde in the start of the manga) that's worn parted to his left, a 
                            prominently longer piece curving upwards on the side of his head, resembling a horn of sorts, and narrow, 
                            inward-tilting blue eyes. The most distinctive physical trait of Norman is his thick eyebrows. He wore the 
                            standard orphanage uniform—a white shirt and trousers along with plain shoes. His Grace Field House 
                            identification number "22194" is tattooed across the left side of his neck. Norman is a calm, level-headed, 
                            kind, and gentle boy who presents himself to have figured things out because he wants to appear as a reliable 
                            person to people around him. At the same time, Norman is a complex individual due to his conflicting morality. 
                            After being exposed to the truth behind the orphanage, Norman is revealed to be similar to Ray, as in being a 
                            realist and wanting to take a limited group of people along in the escape. However, he deems himself as being selfish 
                            due to worrying about his own life, as opposed to Emma who selflessly worries about others first before herself. 
                            Norman's love for Emma inspires him to follow her idealistic ideals, and as so he becomes determined to escape with 
                            all of his siblings despite it seeming impossible. To achieve this, Norman has shown to be manipulative, ruthless 
                            and extremely rational, having no issues agreeing to the plan to kill Krone and Isabella that Ray came up with in 
                            order to escape.</p>
