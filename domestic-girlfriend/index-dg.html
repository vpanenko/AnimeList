                    <p class="text">Natsuo Fujii (藤井 夏生, Fujii Natsuo) is the main male protagonist of Domestic na Kanojo. He is 
                        introduced as a second-year high school student who loves writing novels, so he frequently heads to the rooftop 
                        during his lunch breaks to develop his passion. It is there that he meets the rookie English teacher named Hina 
                        Tachibana, who becomes his first crush. Natsuo is a young man with black hair and olive green eyes. His current 
                        appearance is far different from his junior high days thanks to following the suggestion of Fumiya Kurimoto 
                        (Natsuo's best friend), who forced him to wear contact lenses instead of eye glasses and have his curly hair 
                        flattened daily.Natsuo is a kind and friendly teenager who's sensitivity and insight make him a chick magnet, 
                        although he doesn't notice it straight forward because of his obliviousness. He's a highly adaptive individual,
                        easily doing teamwork as well as becoming competitive when required. He has a very active imagination, of course, 
                        but because of that, it is not unusual for him to have lecherous thoughts that assault him from time to time, even 
                        though he truly tries to control them. He assumes every compromise as seriously as he can, avoiding letting others 
                        down. This has led him to learn to bottle up his feelings when he considers they might be a burden to the people 
                        that trust him. He is responsible and hardworking, but due to his sensitivity, he can't help getting depressed - 
                        usually needing the help of others to come back. As the series develops, he gains maturity, but still, his lack of 
                        experience due to his youth puts him in some very awkward situations, which he tries to deal with the best way he 
                        can.</p>

                            She is the younger sister of Hina Tachibana, but soon after Tsukiko Tachibana (Rui's divorced mother) marries 
                            Natsuo's father, Akihito Fujii, Rui becomes Natsuo Fujii's step-sister. At the beginning, Rui was an aloof and 
                            blunt girl who was hard to read emotionally. Her standoffish personality made it difficult for her to socialize; 
                            the first time she appears in the story, at a mixer, she didn't do much to interact with others. During the 
                            story progression, Rui goes through a lot of change. Throughout the story, she opens up to people around her, 
                            becoming more emotionally expressive and more social, and she realizes her own ambition to become a chef and 
                            begins to reach towards that dream. Rui is the younger of two daughters of Tsukiko Tachibana and her ex-husband, 
                            whom she divorced after he admitted to infidelity. Rui grew up having to deal with her mother's constant 
                            disparaging talk about her father, which upsets her greatly. This changes for the best once Tsukiko meets 
                            Akihito Fujii.</p>

                                She is the elder sister of Rui Tachibana, and after Tsukiko Tachibana (Hina's divorced mother) marries a 
                                widower named Akihito Fujii, Hina becomes the stepsister of Natsuo Fujii. Hina is a young woman with 
                                waist-length dark brown hair that has trimmed bangs which are parted above her right eye, emerald eyes,

                                of her when she's in swimwear. Her natural beauty combined with her friendly personality has made her an 
                                outcast in high school due to the jealousy of female classmates. Hina is a gentle and pure-hearted young 
                                woman whose cheerful attitude mixed with her naiveness gives her an aura of tenderness impossible to go 
                                unnoticed, even though she is a little bit clumsy and helpless at cooking. That actually caused her some 
                                distress back in her second year of high school, when her female friends out of jealousy decided to shun her.</p>
