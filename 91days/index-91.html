        <p>91 Days is a 2016 anime series produced by Studio Shuka. It premiered in Japan on July 9, 2016 and concluded on October 1, 
            2016. Crunchyroll aired the series subbed on its streaming service as it premiered in Japan, while FUNimation Entertainment
            began airing an English dub of the series on its streaming service FunimationNow on October 23, 2016. The story is set in the
            fictional form of America during the last years of Prohibition in 1932, where brewed liquor dominates the black market thanks
            to the Italian Mafia. Angelo Lagusa, a young man whose family was murdered in a Mafia dispute, seeks revenge against the Vanetti
            Family, particularly its Don, Vincent Vanetti which is the Mafiosi that controls Lawless district, and one of the high ranking
            members of the Cosa Nostra. After seven years in hiding in the Midwest following the night of the murder, Angelo receives an 
            anonymous letter from a friend of his father's, prompting him to return to Lawless and exact his revenge. Under the name of
            Avilio Bruno, he begins to infiltrate the Vanetti clan by slowly befriending the Don's son, Nero. However, in this dramatic
            91-day story, revenge breeds revenge, and killing may yield drastic consequences. How will Angelo Lagusa and Nero Vanetti fare,
            in this tragic harvest field that they have only begun to sow?</p>

                <p class="text">Angelo Lagusa is the main protagonist of 91 Days. He is an orphan who lost both of his parents and younger
                     brother to the Vanetti Family, having witnessed them being gunned down on his birthday. As a result, he harbors a deep
                     grudge. This grudge is awakened when he receives a mysterious letter in the mail from an anonymous man who claims to be
                     a 'friend of his father'. With this letter in hand, he later earns the trust of the Vanetti family through a series of 
                     events and joins them in order to avenge his family by killing those responsible for their deaths. "He's so creepy. I can't tell if he's alive or dead."
                     â€•Angelo's landlady about him
                     Angelo is a young man with a thin build. He has an undercut with dark blueish-brown hair that is not slicked back and
                     hazel eyes. Furthermore, he has thin eyebrows and usually has a monotone expression on his face, so much so that it is
                     referred to as creepy because it is hard to tell if he's alive or dead. As the story progresses and he becomes more
                     stressed, he gets dark bags under his eyes. As a child, he looked very similar to his adult stature, with similarly cut
                     dark brown hair, as well as hazel eyes and a thin build. Though he lost his cheery disposition as he aged.
                     As a child, Angelo was a brave, sweet boy who was very empathetic towards those he was close to, such as his brother 
                     and Corteo. He cared deeply for his family. After their deaths, he felt alone and miserable, regretting not being 
                     murdered along with them. This event traumatized Angelo and he was forced into a life of petty crime to survive.</p>
