            <p class="character-info">Tatsumi is the main protagonist of Akame Ga Kill!. A young fighter
                 who had set out along with two childhood friends to make a name for himself and earn money
                 for his village, Tatsumi is a kindhearted person who wants everyone to live happily, but 
                 has no problem with becoming violent if his friends or his ideals are threatened. Tatsumi 
                 is a young man of average height with green eyes and medium length brown hair with a cowlick 
                 that falls with its weight. He used to wear a white, high collar jacket over a tan sweater vest,
                 a pair of black pants, brown gloves and combat boots, but later changes his outfit and now has a 
                 more traditional white assassin jacket over a slim purple hoodie and a black base layer shirt with 
                 black jeans. On his back, he carries Incursio's key, a short sword with a chain-link tassel at the
                 hilt, in its sheath.Tatsumi gives off a kind, generous, level-headed and friendly vibe. He was shown 
                 to be a bit arrogant and naive in the early chapters, when in his first appearance he believed he could
                 be given an immediate rank of Captain in the armed forces. He displays great displeasure of killing
                 unless provoked as shown from finding his friends tortured to death.

        <p class="character-info">Akame, also known as Akame of the Demon Sword Murasame, is the titular heroine, alongside
             Tatsumi, and lead anti-heroine of the manga series Akame ga Kill!, as well as the main protagonist of the prequel 
             manga Akame ga Kill! Zero. She also appears as a main supporting character in Hinowa ga Yuku!, mainly as Hinata's 
             personal tutor of swordsmanship and Elder's Class combat tutor. Originally sold to the Empire along with her sister
             Kurome to be trained as an assassin, Akame eventually defected to the rebels when she was sent to assassinate General 
             Najenda, the leader of Night Raid and joined them to overthrow the corrupt monarchy.Akame is a pretty young girl with long 
             black hair that reaches down to her knees and red eyes. She wears a dark sleeveless top with a white collar and a red tie; 
             she wears a red belt that has a red side skirt cover over a black, pleated skirt. She wears it with long black socks and 
             black shoes. She also wears red gauntlets and black gloves. She sometimes wears a long dark coat in battle.
             Akame appears to be a very serious
             and cold-hearted person which stems from her hellish training that the Empire forced her and her sister through, but it 
             is eventually revealed that she is just socially awkward. She cares about her comrades very much and she is always worried
             that one of them may not make it out alive due to her first-hand experience that war always has a high mortality rate. 
             After Tatsumi fought Ogre, she stripped him of his clothes to check his body for wounds and Akame rushes to Mt. Kageboshi
             to aid Hinata who was about to be killed by Yomihime.</p>
