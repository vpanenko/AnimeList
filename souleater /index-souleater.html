        <p>Soul Eater (Japanese: ソウルイーター, Hepburn: Sōru Ītā) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Atsushi Ohkubo.
             Set at the "Death Weapon Meister Academy", the series revolves around three teams, each consisting of a weapon meister and
             (at least one) weapon that can transform into a humanoid. Trying to make the latter a "death scythe" and thus fit for use 
             by the academy's headmaster Shinigami, the personification of death, they must collect the souls of 99 evil humans and one
             witch, in that order; otherwise, they will have to start all over again.</p>

                     the daughter of Spirit Albarn, the Grim Reaper's current weapon partner. Disgusted by her father's antics, she followed
                     in her mother's footsteps and became a scythe-meister partnered with the magic scythe, Soul Eater, in order to create a
                     death scythe more powerful than her father. Maka is a flat-chested, teenage young woman with light taupe hair which she
                     keeps in pigtails, although there are certain times she may stylize them into buns or wear them straight down. Maka's
                     primary outfit is a typical schoolgirl outfit consisting of a white blouse with a yellow sweater vest, a green striped
                     tie, a red plaid skirt, and black boots with white buckles. When using Soul, she usually wears white gloves. Maka also
                     wears a trench coat with a cloak-like ends.Possessing a rather serious personality, Maka is a studious girl with 
                     excellent grades and is noted to be courageous enough to fight against fear itself. She is, however, repulsed by
                     womanizing antics such as that from her father.</p>

                         After discovering his weapon abilities as a demon scythe, Soul joined Death Weapon Meister Academy 
                         where he partnered with the scythe-meister, Maka Albarn. Soul's attitude is laid-back and nonchalant
                         at the start of the series, as he tries to mold himself to his expectations of how someone "cool" would
                         act. He is almost the complete opposite of Maka Albarn, being reserved and aloof. He often expresses how he
                         feels about some situations by either claiming that something is "cool" or "not cool", Being a cool guy, he 
                         prefers to use the direct or stupid approach, which most of the time fails. According to Dr. Franken Stein, 
                         Soul's soul is "careless and arrogant" as a reflection of his attempt to be "cool" and "above it all".
                         Soul has white hair swept to one side and red eyes. He is known for his heavily exaggerated facial expressions
                         and pointed teeth. He naturally has a lazy, droopy, and somewhat uninterested expression on his face.</p>

                             Created from a piece of Death himself, Death the Kid is known to be one of the top 3 EAT students in the 
                             DWMA. Death the Kid appears as a thin, teenaged young man who is a bit shorter than Liz and Patty and reaches
                             only up a little past the latter's shoulder. Kid's eyes have two shades of yellow ringing around his pupil.
                             The outside ring is a bright yellow while the inner ring is a dark yellow, similar to the color of gold. He
                             typically sports a standard black suit with white rectangles. The rectangles are placed in a manner that
                             is completely symmetrical. Described as possessing an "uptight personality" by Franken Stein, Death the Kid 
                             is known to be a normally calm and mature individual compared to those like Black☆Star and Soul Eater.
                             Throughout the series, he's shown to be prideful of his status as a Shinigami, wanting to become the next 
                             full-fledged Shinigami and inheriting his father's responsibilities. However, he also wants to do so in his
                             own unique way, even telling his own father he wants to makes his own weapons to his specifications despite
                             Death informing him that as a Shinigami, he doesn't really need to collect souls.</p>

                                 convinced that any ghost she meets is out to eat her (where her paranoia severely irritates the ghosts

                                     of Elizabeth Thompson. Known as one of the "Demon Twin Guns", both her and her sister were known 
                                     as the "Brooklyn Devils" and were petty thugs until being found by their now current Meister and 
                                     Shinigami, Death the Kid. Overtime, she reformed from her thieving and ruffian ways along with Liz
                                     and became Kid's weapon and later becoming DWMA students within the E.A.T Class. She is also 
                                     formerly a member of Spartoi. Patty acts and speaks like a young child, often using a singsong voice.
                                     She pronounces words like "hello" and "sorry", as a child would "hullo" and "sowwy", and seems to still
                                     be learning about simple things such as assigning animal noises to the right animal. This child-like
                                     disposition can lead to her coming across as nosy or insensitive, such as when she boldly asks if Crona
                                     is a boy or a girl .</p>

                                     Black☆Star. She is one of the members of the famous Nakatsukasa Family, a special magic weapon 
                                     family whose select members are known inherit all the previous magic dark arm transformations and 
                                     the Enchanted Blade. As one of the oldest members of her teammates, Tsubaki is one of the most mature
                                     and level-headed , aside from Maka. However, she is not as short-tempered as the scythe meister, and
                                     is very patient and forgiving. She has a very magnanimous, polite and gentle personality and always tries 
                                     to help or comfort her friends even when she has no idea how to help. She is caring and understanding and 
                                     sometimes acts as the mediator when her friends fight, and her understanding and insight sometimes makes her
                                     the agony aunt figure for people who are troubled. She wears a pale yellow, sleeveless outfit with a skirt end 
                                     that has a slit down the side with a bright yellow star emblazoned on the right side of the chest. She also wears 
                                     a dark brown scarf and a tight dark brown stocking on her right leg starting just above the knee and white boots. 
                                     She wears a sash that looks similar to Black☆Star's grey riveted straps that wraps around her waist twice and hangs
                                     down diagonally from right to left.</p>
