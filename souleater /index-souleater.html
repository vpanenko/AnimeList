        <p>Soul Eater (Japanese: ソウルイーター, Hepburn: Sōru Ītā) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Atsushi Ohkubo.
             Set at the "Death Weapon Meister Academy", the series revolves around three teams, each consisting of a weapon meister and
             (at least one) weapon that can transform into a humanoid. Trying to make the latter a "death scythe" and thus fit for use 
             by the academy's headmaster Shinigami, the personification of death, they must collect the souls of 99 evil humans and one
             witch, in that order; otherwise, they will have to start all over again.</p>

                <p class="text"> Maka Albarn (マカ・アルバーン, Maka Arubān) is a one-star scythe meister at Death Weapon Meister Academy and 
                     the daughter of Spirit Albarn, the Grim Reaper's current weapon partner. Disgusted by her father's antics, she followed
                     in her mother's footsteps and became a scythe-meister partnered with the magic scythe, Soul Eater, in order to create a
                     death scythe more powerful than her father. Maka is a flat-chested, teenage young woman with light taupe hair which she
                     keeps in pigtails, although there are certain times she may stylize them into buns or wear them straight down. Maka's
                     primary outfit is a typical schoolgirl outfit consisting of a white blouse with a yellow sweater vest, a green striped
                     tie, a red plaid skirt, and black boots with white buckles. When using Soul, she usually wears white gloves. Maka also
                     wears a trench coat with a cloak-like ends.Possessing a rather serious personality, Maka is a studious girl with 
                     excellent grades and is noted to be courageous enough to fight against fear itself. She is, however, repulsed by
                     womanizing antics such as that from her father.</p>

                    <p class="text">Soul (ソウル, Sōru), is a demon weapon who was born into a family of famous musicians.
                         After discovering his weapon abilities as a demon scythe, Soul joined Death Weapon Meister Academy 
                         where he partnered with the scythe-meister, Maka Albarn. Soul's attitude is laid-back and nonchalant
                         at the start of the series, as he tries to mold himself to his expectations of how someone "cool" would
                         act. He is almost the complete opposite of Maka Albarn, being reserved and aloof. He often expresses how he
                         feels about some situations by either claiming that something is "cool" or "not cool", Being a cool guy, he 
                         prefers to use the direct or stupid approach, which most of the time fails. According to Dr. Franken Stein, 
                         Soul's soul is "careless and arrogant" as a reflection of his attempt to be "cool" and "above it all".
                         Soul has white hair swept to one side and red eyes. He is known for his heavily exaggerated facial expressions
                         and pointed teeth. He naturally has a lazy, droopy, and somewhat uninterested expression on his face.</p>

                             the second son of Death himself and the Meister of the Demon Twin Guns, Liz Thompson and Patty Thompson.
                             Created from a piece of Death himself, Death the Kid is known to be one of the top 3 EAT students in the 
                             DWMA. Death the Kid appears as a thin, teenaged young man who is a bit shorter than Liz and Patty and reaches
                             only up a little past the latter's shoulder. Kid's eyes have two shades of yellow ringing around his pupil.
                             The outside ring is a bright yellow while the inner ring is a dark yellow, similar to the color of gold. He
                             typically sports a standard black suit with white rectangles. The rectangles are placed in a manner that
                             is completely symmetrical. Described as possessing an "uptight personality" by Franken Stein, Death the Kid 
                             is known to be a normally calm and mature individual compared to those like Black☆Star and Soul Eater.
                             Throughout the series, he's shown to be prideful of his status as a Shinigami, wanting to become the next 
                             full-fledged Shinigami and inheriting his father's responsibilities. However, he also wants to do so in his
                             own unique way, even telling his own father he wants to makes his own weapons to his specifications despite
                             Death informing him that as a Shinigami, he doesn't really need to collect souls.</p>
